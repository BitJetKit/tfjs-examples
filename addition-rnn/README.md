# TensorFlow.js Example: Addition RNN

This example uses an RNN: to compute a two integer difference; but it does
string => string translation. Although it is not the best two integer subtraction computed, it is a working example.

Note: this example is a modification of a port of the Keras addition RNN example with a UI.

You can find the original port [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/).

You can find the original Keras python code [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/addition_rnn.py).
